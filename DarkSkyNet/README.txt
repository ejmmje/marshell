Hi there!
Welcome to my final project where I created a chat bot where you can ask for the weather in any city in the world!
It is very simple to run:

1. run the file 'chatbot.py' in a program such as terminal or GitBash.
2. Be kind! Say hello to the bot and you can have a conversation if you would like.
3. To ask about the weather, it is important that you type in the correct syntax as it is CASE-SENSITIVE!
  You can ask one of these seven commands using the exact syntax and replacing the portion in parentheses:
    What's the weather like in (city)?
    Is it going to rain in (city) today?
    How hot will it get in (city) today?
    How cold will it get in (city) today?
    Is it going to rain in (city) this week?
    How hot will it get in (city) this week?
    How cold will it get in (city) this week?
For each one of the statements, my weatherbot will return the answer to all of your weather desires.

For the rain statements, I have filtered for snow.
      If the average temperature through the day(for daily rain) or week(for weekly rain) is below 32.00 degrees, the bot will inform you that it may or may not snow instead of rain.

Lastly, if you enter an incorrect city, my bot will inform you that you may have made a typing error and feel free to re-enter the request with the correct spelling of a city.
